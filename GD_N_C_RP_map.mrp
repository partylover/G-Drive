  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:MapLib:41 - All members of TNM group "CLKMAINi_XLXI_5_clkout4" have been
   optimized out of the design.
WARNING:MapLib:50 - The period specification "TS_CLKMAINi_XLXI_5_clkout4" has
   been discarded because the group "CLKMAINi_XLXI_5_clkout4" has been optimized
   away.
WARNING:Timing:3223 - Timing constraint TS_TO_ETH_DRIVEiETH_TX2iPHY_TXD_b_6_LD = MAXDELAY TO TIMEGRP "TO_ETH_DRIVEiETH_TX2iPHY_TXD_b_6_LD"
   TS_RX_CLK DATAPATHONLY ignored during timing analysis.
WARNING:Place:1206 - This design contains a global buffer instance,
   <CLKMAINi/XLXI_5/clkout2_buf>, driving the net, <PHY_CLK25_OBUF>, that is
   driving the following (first 30) non-clock load pins off chip.
   < PIN: PHY_CLK25.O; >
   This design practice, in Spartan-6, can lead to an unroutable situation due
   to limitations in the global routing. If the design does route there may be
   excessive delay or skew on this net. It is recommended to use a Clock
   Forwarding technique to create a reliable and repeatable low skew solution:
   instantiate an ODDR2 component; tie the .D0 pin to Logic1; tie the .D1 pin to
   Logic0; tie the clock net to be forwarded to .C0; tie the inverted clock to
   .C1. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was
   applied on COMP.PIN <CLKMAINi/XLXI_5/clkout2_buf.O> allowing your design to
   continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the
   specified COMP.PIN.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
  11 block(s) removed
  24 block(s) optimized away
   4 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
